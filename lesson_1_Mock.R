wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it
was the epoch of incredulity, it it was the season of Light, it was the
season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of

were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other
way- in short, the period was so far like the present period, that
some of its noiosiest authorities insisted on its being received, for
good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only."
